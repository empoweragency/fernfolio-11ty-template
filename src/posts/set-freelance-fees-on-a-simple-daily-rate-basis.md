Regarding the question of setting freelance fees on a simple daily rate basis, I would recommend as follows.

Step 1: Estimate what YOU would expect to be able to get per annum in perm employment, including cash benefits such as bonus, car allowance etc., but excluding things like pension, private medical insurance etc. Don’t be too modest about this. You are presumably good at what you do, otherwise you wouldn’t be a consultant! Note that this may well NOT be the same as what some manager in any given client company might be paid.

Step 2: Determine or estimate the annual value of all your overheads and business expenses, excluding VAT (but note that ‘assignment-related’ expenses should not be included in this calculation but should be billed as additional to the daily rate charges). Include any pension contributions, healthcare premium etc. in these overheads.

Step 3: This is often overlooked! Calculate a profit or mark-up to provide contingency against the risks of running your own business, also to give you some cash to invest in your business. The risks include market downturns, bad debt, long term sickness, tax investigation, litigation, tax hikes etc. Don’t forget you’ve got no notice periods, no redundancy payments and no sick pay! The profit should typically be 15% to 25% of the total of Step 1 and Step 2 above.

Step 4: Add together the outputs from 1 to 3 above, i.e. Personal Income + Overheads + Profit. This sum total is your target Sales Revenue / annum.

Step 5: Estimate the number of days a year on average that will be spent on chargeable work. As an independent consultant, you’ve not only got to allow for holidays and a few sick days, but also for the fact that you will almost certainly have to spend a vast number of your working days on non-chargeable activities such as sales, marketing, admin and professional development. The result is that over the long term you can only budget for about 12 chargeable days a month, i.e. about 140 to 150 a year. Note that many people grossly over-estimate the number of chargeable days a year.

Step 6: It follows that you’ve got to generate your revenue target in the number of days that are charged, so divide your Sales Revenue / annum target by 150 chargeable days (or 140). This is your daily rate and you can round it up to say the nearest £10.

Note that this rate is exclusive of ‘assignment-related’ expenses and VAT.

Note that it’s going to be considerably more than the daily pay of a perm employee and so it should be, because you’re running a business with overheads and considerable risks. Also you should be providing a very large return on investment! Most consultants under-charge. Resist all attempts by potential clients to compare your rate with that of perm employee. It’s like comparing a Rolls-Royce with a Ford Focus, both motor cars, but with very different costs of manufacture and very different benefits.
