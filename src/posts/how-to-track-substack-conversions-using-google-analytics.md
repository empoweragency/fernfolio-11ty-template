Here’s how…

## Step 1: Set up Google Analytics

* Make sure you have Google Analytics set up.
* You’re going to need to find your tracking ID.
* To do that, login to Google Analytics
* Click Admin and then select Property Settings.
* You’ll want to find your tracking ID. Copy that.

## Step 2: Add Google Analytics Account ID to Substack

* Login to Substack and click Settings.
* You’re looking for the Advertising Analytics section of Substack.
* Take that Account ID and paste it in the third slot.
* It should look something like. UA-XXXXX-1

## Step 3: Set up conversion tracking.

* To do this, go back to Google Analytics.
* On the left sidebar, click Conversion.
* In that dropdown, click Ecommerce.
* Then click Overview.
* It’ll ask you to enable Ecommerce feature.
* Follow the quick steps.

## And that’s it!
